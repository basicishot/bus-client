# Bus Client  

Bus Client is a **feature-packed** mod menu for Gorilla Tag copies, built by crimson and seamus. Whether you just want mods, are a developer, or anything inbetween, this menu has you covered. Designed to be **as useful as possible**, it includes a variety of features and options that let you customize your modding experience to your heart's content.  

> Why settle for boring when you can have *stupidly* good?

  <summary><b>💡 Why open-source?</b></summary>
	
Great question. The modding community used to be about **sharing, learning, and improving** together. But nowadays, everything's locked behind **paywalls and obfuscation**. That's not how it should be.  

By making this menu open-source, I'm giving **everyone** the opportunity to:  
- Learn how mod menus work 
- Experiment with new ideas  
- Contribute to the Gorilla Tag modding scene  
- ⭐ **Keep modding free and accessible**  

Let's bring back the collaboration of modding. No paywalls, no secrets, no malware, just good mods.
